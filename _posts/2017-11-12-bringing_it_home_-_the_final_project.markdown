Finishing the final project feels like such an epic moment.  The end of something big but also the start of something bigger.  At a time like this you can't help but look back and realize how far you've come.  This project was a perfect representation of all we have learned as it used so many of our new found skills.

For my last project I developed a budget tracking app to help you keep track of monthly expenses, look at the annual totals of those expenses and compare them to after-tax earnings and return on invested assets.  I believe that simple tools for people to use to both learn about and monitor their financial health is a great area for app development.  As a propfessional money manager I was always amazed by what the aveage person doesn't know.  Given how critical our financial health is, it is craazy to me that financial skills are not taught to children in school at a young age.  It is also amazing how few people know exactly how they are spending their money each year.  My tool allows you to do simple 'what-if' analysis of your financial situation and I can see adding more features in future versions to do things like track saving for you children's future college expenses, track savings for retirement, and tools to examine debt such as a mortgage and the impact of prepaying that debt.

I am excited for my next step - job hunting.  I hope to find a way to use the tools I have learned and earned to work on propblems that I am passionate about, such as this one.  Onward and upward!
