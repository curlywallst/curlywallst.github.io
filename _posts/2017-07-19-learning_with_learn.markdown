I am constantly reminded, while plugging through the lessons, how important my end of the learning to code contract is.  Today I finished a lesson on forms and layouts.  I looked at the solution after I was cleared to move on to the next lesson.  I have learned the following from consistently doing this:

1. There is almost always more than one way to solve a problem.  And many of them are good ways!  The richness of Ruby means that there are often many different elegant ways to write the same basic code.  But I always learn from looking at the other ways that are available to me.  My end of the learning contract is to not try to just pass the test and move on, but to make sure I understand WHY it works and how else might I have approached it.

2. Tests do not cover every aspect.  You may be able to get by the test but you may not have solved the problem.  Case in point:  I was working on a lab about rendering partials with locals.  It required that I add a method to a model.  I was happy with my succinct code that accomplished exactly the correct search function.  I passed the tests.  Yay!  Luckily I checked the results.  Oops.  No where had I implemented querying the user for what to search for or rendering the search results.  I was so wrapped up in getting the search method to work that I forgot to step back and look at the big picture.  I passed the test but failed the assignment.

I am naturally curious and have always wanted to understand the why.  But I have also sometimes been a bull in a china shop, diving into something without taking the time to fully plan out the process and results I am looking for.  Watching Avi's videos I am struck by how he always starts by writing out what he intends to achieve.  Going forward I resolve to do the same.  One more great lesson I have learned with Learn!
