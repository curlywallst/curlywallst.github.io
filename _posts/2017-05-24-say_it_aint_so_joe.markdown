Having worked day and night on my CLI Scraping app I thought it was pretty good.  Then I decided to attend a study group pertaining to the lab.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.  As our excellent instructor went through question after question I realized that my lab just wasn't good enough.  Things that I thought were not doable were oh so doable.  And my elegant solutions were not so elegant.  I realized I had to reboot.  So I dug in and spent the night fixing everything.  Grabbed a few hours of sleep and got right back to it today.  I finally had everything perfect - or as perfect as I could get it - with only the video left.  I was proud of my stick-to-it-ness and was excited to finish up.

And then the real test.  I was doing some testing to make sure it worked in every case and I guess I scraped too many times.  The website must have decided that I was a hacker and it locked me out for good.  Wow - my lowest moment.  But I jumped on slack and asked for help and Avi himself reponded.  His first suggestion was to use another website.  My heart sank.  Start over?  Oh no.  He pointed out that this happens all the time in the working world.  I had to stop and think for a moment - am I just a person that easily gives up or is stuck on my way or the highway?  No.  I have to say that wasn't it.  I enjoyed the project but I am ready to move on to the next lesson and learn more.  I am absolutely sure that if this had happened in a work setting I would have groaned and then laughed and started over.  I have enough time in the working world under my belt to know that I am very good at rolling with the punches.

Luckily Avi suggested that I mock it up by downloading local copies of the web pages.  I remembered our student scraper and went to that for an example.  Very cool.  I had to modify a bit of the code and now can't turn it into a gem to publish but I still learned from the situation.
