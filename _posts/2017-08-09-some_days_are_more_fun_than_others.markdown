One thing that is difficult about online learning is not having access to live people all the time.  The support people are wonderful but as a person living far away, as the labs get more difficult the time one chews up bringing the helper up to speed on your code eats up all the time they have to spend with you.  We will face many of the same issues when we hit the real world.  Hopefully the users that you are programming for have the time necessary to fully spec out the problem.  The tests are amazing but there is often more than one reasonably good solution and the tests cannot test for anything other than what they have been set up for.  

Working in this environment is similar to when you are working on someone else's code, I suppose.  You can't necessarily do it your way.  And if the original programmer has left the company, you may not even have access to the how and why it way done the way it was done.  From that aspect, the online environment is a great preparation for things to come!
